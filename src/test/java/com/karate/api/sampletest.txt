This document outlines key challenges and proposes solutions to optimize OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) support for the [Your Development Team Name]. Our team's unique development – utilizing non-standard, highly customized frameworks, complex containerized Gradle execution, and memory-intensive tasks – frequently creates support bottlenecks. As critical partners in OCP's evolution (e.g., VPA enablement), a more tailored and collaborative support model is essential.

1. Our Unique Development & OCP Partnership
The [Your Development Team Name] builds highly customized, high-performance solutions using:

Custom Frameworks: Bespoke grid computing, unique message queuing.
Containerized Gradle: Complex, memory-intensive build/execution.
Unique Tech Stacks: Specialized compilers, runtimes.
We are also key OCP partners, driving innovation through:

P5.1 - Early Adopters: First to test and implement new OCP features (e.g., VPA).
P5.2 - PoC Initiatives: Pushing OCP boundaries with complex use cases.
P5.3 - Real-World Case Studies: Demonstrating OCP robustness for non-standard workloads.
P5.4 - Unilateral Knowledge Sharing: Providing insights back to OCP team.
2. OCP Support Pain Points Checklist
Current OCP support model causes inefficiencies for our team:

Lack of Framework Awareness:
P1.1: Unfamiliarity with our proprietary grid/custom frameworks.
P1.2: Limited understanding of containerized Gradle complexities.
Generic Troubleshooting:
P2.1: Ineffective first-line support using generic steps.
P2.2: Prolonged resolution for unique, non-standard issues.
Resource Misunderstandings:
P3.1: Inadequate generic resource recommendations for memory-intensive, bursty workloads.
P3.2: Difficulty correlating OCP metrics with our custom application metrics.
Communication Gaps:
P4.1: Repeated explanations of our stack and context on every ticket.
P4.2: No dedicated support channels or pre-briefed personnel for our team.
3. Proposed Next Steps: Towards Collaborative Support
To establish a more efficient and beneficial partnership:

3.1. Immediate Actions:

N1.1 - Dedicated Technical Liaison: Establish a specific OCP support contact familiar with our stack.
N1.2 - Framework Briefings: Conduct knowledge-transfer sessions from our team to the OCP liaison(s).
N1.3 - Shared Knowledge Base: Collaborate on a living document for our unique OCP deployments.
3.2. Mid-Term Initiatives:

N2.1 - Proactive Resource Review: Jointly plan and review resource allocation for new deployments.
N2.2 - Enhanced Observability: Integrate/correlate our custom metrics with OCP monitoring.
N2.3 - PoC Support Sandbox: Establish a clear, fast-track channel for experimental PoC support.
3.3. Long-Term Vision:

N3.1 - Formal Partnership Agreement: Explore a formal SLA acknowledging our unique needs and contributions.
N3.2 - Joint Innovation Sessions: Regular collaborative sessions for architectural guidance on new tech.
N3.3 - Integrated Feedback Loop: Formalize a process for our feedback to influence OCP support/training.
4. Conclusion
The [Your Development Team Name] is committed to maximizing OCP's potential. By addressing these challenges and implementing the proposed collaborative model, we can enhance efficiency, accelerate development, and strengthen OCP's overall value within the organization. We welcome discussion on these vital improvements.
