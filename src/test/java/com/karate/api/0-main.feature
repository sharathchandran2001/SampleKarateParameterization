Feature: web and api

Background:
* def vFileChooserPath = Java.type('com.karate.api.JavaUtil').fileChoose()



Scenario: API Main feature for later purpose
* print 'Mainfile vFileChooserPath'+vFileChooserPath

# Calling first feature file
* call read('1-karate-driver-and-api.feature')




1. Value of the Middleware API System
Here’s how to frame the value proposition for both provider (QD) and consumers (QF, PS, others):

Provider (QD / QT) Benefits
Standardized Integration: No need to maintain custom adapters or endpoints per consumer — Middleware translates consumer language to provider API contracts.

Security Control Point: Middleware can implement auth/rate-limiting/throttling without changes to provider APIs.

Usage Analytics: Can track how consumers interact, what data is most accessed — helps with prioritizing and improving provider features.

Low Impact On Provider: Reduces direct load by filtering invalid or bad calls (fuzzy matching fallback, retry logic).

Extensibility: Middleware can evolve separately (add caching, retries, etc.) without requiring QD to change.


Consumer (QF, PS, etc.) Benefits
Natural Language Access: Consumers don’t need to know technical APIs; Gherkin/NLP-like interface makes it easier to use.

Stable Interface: Even if backend APIs change, Middleware maintains a consistent contract for consumers.

Faster Onboarding: New consumers can integrate quickly without learning internal QD APIs.

Retry, Rate-limiting & Resilience Built-In: Reduces consumer complexity; they get reliable, self-healing API access.

Data Discovery: Middleware can help match ambiguous consumer queries to the most relevant provider data.

Executive-Level Summary (for Manager)
The Middleware API system simplifies and accelerates consumer onboarding, reduces provider maintenance, and enables better governance and observability between systems. It decouples data access from backend evolution, making QD more scalable and future-ready.


2. How to Design Early for Custom Use Cases
You're already thinking right with customer surveys. Let’s make it stronger:

Tactics for Early Design Success
a) Customer Discovery Framework
Run structured interviews and surveys to understand:

Types of test data needed (credit, personal, mortgage, fraud, etc.)

Expected response formats (JSON, nested objects, schema structure)

Frequency and volume of access

Edge cases and errors they’ve faced with previous systems

b) Create a Use Case Matrix
Map each consumer to:

Test scenario types

Preferred data formats

Unique data privacy constraints

Use this to build early capability roadmaps

c) Design with Plug-and-Play Mapping
Enable customers to upload or register their own step-to-endpoint mappings

Middleware can store these mappings per customer

Add a fallback strategy if mapping is missing

d) Offer Mock Data or a Sandbox API
Let consumers try the middleware with test data before formal integration

Encourages feedback and early discovery of gaps

e) Involve Consumers in Middleware Evolution
Offer them a seat in a monthly “Consumer Council”

Share upcoming features, collect feedback — makes them feel invested and heard

Product Owner Message
We’re building Middleware to be customer-centric from day one. By combining early discovery (survey + interview + matrix), a modular mapping engine, and sandbox tryouts, we ensure that it not only meets core use cases but adapts quickly to future needs across multiple verticals.
